:Version: 0.2.99.11

---------
0.2.99.11
---------
Hopefully the last in this line of API.

* Fix handling of tg_format=json asa query param when the server uses
  tg.util.request_format()
* Add a default jsonify method for SA ResultProxys
* Don't traceback if there's a corrupted session file
* Set permissions on the session file so only the user can read it.
* Add a default BaseURL for fas2.AccountSystem

---------
0.2.99.10
---------
* Minor update that:

  1) Adds bugzilla email to the return from people_by_id().

  2) Adds several more users whose bugzilla address don't match their fas email.

--------
0.2.99.9
--------
* This is what 0.2.99.9 was supposed to be.  The last release compatible with
  0.2.99.7 and less.  Unfortunately, some incompatibilities snuck in.
  Reverting those changes here.

--------
0.2.99.8
--------
* Fix a bug involving bugzilla_email addresses.
* Fix a bug where an expired session cookie will cause send_request to complete
  successfully but report failure.

--------
* Fixes to json.py for JSON output with SA-0.4
* Add bugzila_email to output of fas2 methods
* Add people_by_id() method to fas2.AccountSystem that returns a dict of people
  indexed by ID.  The people structure contains username, email, and
  human_name... what we need for most of our lookups.
