'''API to Access the Fedora Account System

This is an alternative python interface to the Fedora Accounts system.
The original website.py module has quite a few issues that we're attempting
to address here:

* We should be able to change from an SQL db to ldap without the consuming
  application being any the wiser.  website.py requires the app to track the
  database handle so that doesn't work well.
* An object oriented interface is preferable to the procedural interface that
  we had before.  Then we can hang onto the database handle and take care of
  authentication within the object.
* Separate out the session handling code from database retrieval code.  This
  will be required when we move to LDAP.
* Separate out the website template code.
* Use psycopg2 instead of pgdb for performance and features.
* Create a pool of connections so we can efficiently call the fas from multiple
  threads.
